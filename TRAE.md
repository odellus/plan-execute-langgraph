# TRAE.md

This is a markdown file intende for trae agent. It contains the instructions for trae-agent to follow.

# INSTRUCTIONS
Add a canvas to our frontend using the example given in `./frontend_canvas_example`. Study what they have done there and compare and contrast with our code, then bring the canvas into our UI. 

Update the backend to use a similar structure as the backend in `./js_backend_canvas_example` but continue to use our approach of fastapi over langgraph in python please.

You were doing a great job at this but got confused and started trying to start the postgres with docker compose up -d db but we're using the postgres that langfuse spins up and exposes on 5432 because uh yeah they have the port occupado.

Figure out where you were in completing the task above first step.

Finish it up.

# RULES
- We use uv, so be sure to source .venv/bin/activate and uv run everything
- Write tests to ensure what you are doing works
- Test often
- Finish soon so I can test it out in UI
- Think sequentially often
